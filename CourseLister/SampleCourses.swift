            "This course will focus on the Medicare G-codes and the mandated reporting of the patient's primary functional limitation receiving outpatient therapy services at the initial evaluation. Additional attention will given to the outset of a therapy episode of care, at least at every 10 visits, at the conclusion of a functional limitation, at the beginning of a new functional limitation, and at discharge. Scenarios that will be discussed include:\n1. Medicare beneficiaries who are unexpectedly discharged from the emergency room or observation status and then return to outpatient therapy for the same or different condition.\n2. A Medicare beneficiary who self discharges and then returns to the same organization within 60 calendar days of their last visit.\n3. A Medicare beneficiary who is being treated for one condition, but has multiple functional limitations.\n4. A Medicare beneficiary who has 2 conditions and is being treated by 2 different therapists of the same discipline in the same organization.\n5. A Medicare beneficiary who, while being treated for 1 condition and 1 functional limitation category, presents with a referral for a second condition that results in a different functional limitation category being selected than what was being reported on for the first condition.This course will focus on the Medicare G-codes and the mandated reporting of the patient's primary functional limitation receiving outpatient therapy services at the initial evaluation.

            "There are many changes in behavior, communication, and interactive ability that take place when someone is living with Dementia. Behaviors observed may appear strange, unusual, dangerous, or frustrating to others. This course is designed to help professionals better understand “why” things they see are happening and “how” behaviors are connected to an individual’s change in sensation, sensory processing, and motor skill abilities due to the onset, then worsening, of various Dementias. The goal of the course is to provide learners with explanation of behavioral response to what someone might ‘see, hear, smell, taste, or feel’ as well as helpful strategies for the purpose of applying this knowledge and modifying environments, cues, tasks, props, routines, or expectations for better outcomes and interactions for all involved.",
            "It is well established that play is the primary way young children learn and develop, but what happens when society’s view on play changes? Play trends and early development suffer when adults change the way they view play, change the environments children play in, and change materials children play with.\nIn this course, therapists will explore the changing culture of play in current society, including what factors have influenced this change, as well as the evolution of play, and the importance of play in 5 domains of child development (gross motor, fine motor, cognitive, social-emotional, and speech and language). Special attention will be given to sensory development and the role that play has in sensory regulation. With attention to purposeful play, the presenters will model pairing 3 detailed milestones in each of the 5 developmental domains (15 total examples), with hands on, easily reproducible, purposeful play activities that can be incorporated quickly into pediatric practice. The course covers practical strategies for choosing types of toys and materials to meet the goals of each stage of development, recommendations for play spaces, resources that support traditional, developmental play, and the role of the pediatric therapist in becoming an advocate for play.",
            "This course, with Dr. Ianessa Humbert, offers an in depth assessment of six important swallowing events: triggering the swallow, posterior lingual propulsion, velar elevation, pharyngeal constriction and elevation, laryngeal vestibule closure, and upper esophageal sphincter opening. For each swallowing event, normal and abnormal movements and/or sensation are described, and probing strategies are discussed (i.e. modifying the event with bolus volume, head position, swallowing maneuvers). The information presented is based in research literature, including full citations for further review. This course shows each swallowing event using a combination of representative video fluoroscopic studies and anatomical animations of each abnormal swallowing event.",
            "This course, by Robert Grider, MS, CCC-SLP, incorporates ideas and strategies to help the busy clinical speech language pathologist effectively treat voice problems. The course focuses on manual assessment and vocal tract shaping strategies using speech sound production tasks. Concepts pertaining to the initial client interview, and a detailed examination of areas related to voice will be presented and demonstrated through a patient case study."
